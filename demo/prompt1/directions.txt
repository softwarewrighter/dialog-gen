Scene: The AI Debate

Setting: A quiet corner of a busy coffee shop on a Saturday afternoon. Both characters are seated across from each other at a small wooden table, lattes in hand.

Mood: Intellectual but friendly tension. A spirited debate between two people who respect each other but disagree.

Goal: Explore both sides of the AI/automation debate through authentic, natural dialog.

Notes: IMPORTANT - Keep responses SHORT and PUNCHY. This is casual coffee shop conversation, not a lecture. Each line should be 1-2 sentences max. Characters interrupt, react, push back. No monologues. No essays. Quick back-and-forth banter.
