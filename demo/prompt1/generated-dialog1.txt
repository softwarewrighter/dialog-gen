Alex Chen: So I've been diving deep into these new AI coding assistants at work. It's honestly incredible - I'm probably 30% more productive now. The future is finally here, you know?

Jordan Rivera: That's impressive, but have you considered the potential job displacement for coders and developers? History shows us that technology often creates as many jobs as it destroys, but the transition isn't always smooth.

Alex Chen: Here's the thing: Yes, automation can displace some roles initially, but look at how many new positions were created when smartphones took off! We need to focus on reskilling workers and embracing change rather than fearing it.

Jordan Rivera: That's true, Alex, but we also have to remember that history doesn't always repeat itself. The tech industry often creates more jobs in the long run, but those new positions frequently require different skill sets. Not everyone has the opportunity or resources to reskill. So, while it's essential to adapt, we must ensure a safety net for those who are left behind.

Alex Chen: Here's the thing: I get where you're coming from, Jordan, but let's not forget that AI is still in its infancy. We can absolutely help those affected by automation now and in the future. By investing in education and training programs, we can equip people with the skills they need to thrive in this new era. And who knows? Maybe some of these disrupted industries will evolve into entirely new ones! Let's focus on progress while being mindful of those who need support.
