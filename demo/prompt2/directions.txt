Scene: The Pitch Meeting

Setting: A modern conference room in a VC firm's office. Michael sits at the head of a small table, Sarah across from him. The pitch deck is closed - they're having a real conversation now.

Mood: High stakes but respectful. Tension with mutual interest.

Goal: Showcase realistic investor-founder dynamics through direct, honest exchange.

Notes: IMPORTANT - Keep responses SHORT and DIRECT. No startup jargon essays. These are busy professionals - they speak in punchy, efficient sentences. 1-2 sentences per turn max. Quick questions, quick answers. Show don't tell.
