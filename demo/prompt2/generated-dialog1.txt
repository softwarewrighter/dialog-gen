Michael Torres: Your deck is solid. Better than most I see. But decks don't run companies. Tell me - and be honest - what keeps you up at night about this business?

Sarah Mitchell: Here's the reality: Scaling our manufacturing process quickly requires significant capital, and while we've bootstrapped so far, it's becoming unsustainable. Let me be direct: I'm concerned about finding an investor who shares my long-term vision for sustainability without compromising profitability.

Michael Torres: Given your need for immediate funding and the importance of aligning on your long-term vision, can you outline specific milestones that demonstrate both financial viability and environmental impact? This will help me understand if our values are aligned.

Sarah Mitchell: Here's a realistic roadmap: Within the next 3 years, we aim to reach a $10M annual revenue while reducing our carbon footprint by 50%. That means doubling production volume without doubling emissions. Over 5 years, we project saving 7 million tons of plastic waste and becoming cash flow positive.

Michael Torres: Walk me through your current carbon footprint and how you plan to achieve the proposed reduction targets. Let's start with the source of your emissions.
