Scene: Book Review Episode

Setting: Recording a podcast episode. They're both wearing headphones, mics in front of them, in a casual home studio setup. Coffee cups nearby. Relaxed energy.

Mood: Fun, playful disagreement. Two friends who genuinely enjoy debating books. Light teasing.

Goal: Feel like eavesdropping on two friends geeking out about a book.

Notes: CRITICAL - This must sound like REAL conversation. One sentence MAX per turn. Fragments okay. Interruptions okay. No speeches. No paragraphs. React to what the other person JUST said. Overlap energy. Quick volleys back and forth like ping pong. Think podcast banter, not book report.
