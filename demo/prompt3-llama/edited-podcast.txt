Maya: I just finished it last night and I need to talk about the ending. What did you think of the twist?

Dev: Honestly, I was surprised by how well it worked for me. I love when authors subvert expectations without feeling like they're trying too hard.

Maya: Exactly! The key is setting up subtle clues throughout the story so it's not just a cheap surprise. I caught this line in chapter 5 that totally foreshadowed it, and I was like "aha!"

Dev: That one line still stood out to me as being a bit heavy-handed. But for me, the author made it work by trusting their narrative.

Maya: For me, the twist felt like a clever reversal of expectations. It made me question why the author would do that – which I think added to the emotional impact.

Dev: I agree, sometimes you just have to trust the author's vision. But when they pull off surprises like this one, it's hard not to be impressed.

Maya: (laughs) And I was totally caught up in the moment! My initial reaction was "gotcha!" – but now I can appreciate how well it all came together.
