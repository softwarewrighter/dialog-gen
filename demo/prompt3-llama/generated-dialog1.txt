Maya: Okay so I finished it last night and I need to talk about that ending.

Dev: I mean, did you expect the author's decision to pay off some obscure plot thread from 300 pages ago?

Maya: Honestly, no way, I was not seeing that coming and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it right?

Dev: To be fair, it's a testament to how well the world is built, because at first glance it just seems like a random twist.

Maya: Right, but then you start digging in, so...

Dev: Look, I've got a whole spreadsheet tracking the different prophecies and timelines now, what about you?

Maya: I'm still trying to keep mine to one notebook, it's like a mini annotated bibliography for my brain.

Dev: I'm there with that, although mine's been more " annotated map of the world with notes on every character's family tree" so far.

Maya: Okay but isn't that just an extension of, like, really getting invested in the story?

Dev: Here's the thing, though: it's one thing to be invested and another to become a full-blown nerd with spreadsheets and annotations.

Maya: Wait don't get me wrong, I'm totally guilty of that too, especially when it comes to things like the mythology in "The Fifth Season"...

Dev: Maya, you're speaking my language now, that worldbuilding is some next-level stuff!

Maya: So, honestly, if they ever do a sequel or adaptation, I'm gonna need an annotated glossary of all those terms because I want to be prepared right?
