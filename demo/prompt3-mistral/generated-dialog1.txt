Maya: Okay so I finished it last night and I need to talk about that ending.

Dev: That ending, though? What was up with that?

Maya: That wasn't the happy ending I was expecting!

Dev: Yeah, that was quite a twist at the end there, huh?

Maya: Yeah, not what I was expecting at all.

Dev: Wow, that caught me off guard. What did you think about it?

Maya: That was unexpected. I'm still processing it.

Dev: Hmm, I can see why you might feel that way. Do you think the author made a conscious decision to end it like that?

Maya: Yeah, definitely.

Dev: Hmm, I wonder if that ending was meant as a commentary on the themes presented in the book?

Maya: Interesting perspective.

Dev: Thank you, I think?

Maya: What did you think of the ending, Dev?
